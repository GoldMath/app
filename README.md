# R6DB Desktop
an electron app to follow and analyse your stats.

## feature ideas:  

 - [ ] timeline view of own profile
 - [ ] searching for other players and seeing total stats
 - [ ] 'following' people to update those profiles regularly
 - [ ] 'recently played with' list
 - [ ] api to allow integration with other tools

## goals:
 - tracking your own stats often and accurately
 - host *everything* locally
 - allow for management of local data

## non-goals:
 - leaderboard
 - tracking everyone you ever came across
 - plugins
