# R6DB Desktop [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/r6db/app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/r6db/app)

a rainbow six stat tracker app.  
this is set up as monorepo. please check the readmes of the individual packages for more info.

## feature ideas:

-   [ ] timeline view of own profile
-   [ ] searching for other players and seeing total stats
-   [ ] 'following' people to update those profiles regularly
-   [ ] 'recently played with' list
-   [ ] api to allow integration with other tools

### goals:

-   tracking your own stats often and accurately
-   host _everything_ locally
-   allow for management of local data

### non-goals:

-   leaderboard
-   tracking everyone you ever came across
-   plugins
